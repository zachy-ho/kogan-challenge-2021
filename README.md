# Kogan Full Stack Web Developer Coding Challenge

## Details
- **Language**: JavaScript (CommonJS module formatting)
- **Implementation explanation**: Even though this is a relatively small
    program, I decided to modularize my code as that is how I usually code
    in actual projects.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/zachy-ho/kogan-challenge-2021.git`
2. Ensure [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is installed on the machine
    running this program
3. Run `npm install` since [node-fetch](https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch)
    is utilized in the program
4. Run `node main.js` to run the program. The program output will be logged on
    the console.
